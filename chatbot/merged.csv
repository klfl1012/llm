etymology of the nick used in nickname?,"The term ""nickname"" is a variant of ""eke-name"" and originates from the Old English root ""eke,"" which means ""a part added on,"" implying that it may have been an additional name rather than a shortened one. 
The compound word ""ekename,"" meaning ""additional name,"" has been in use since the 14th century, and a misdivision of syllables at some point lead to the word ""nickname"" that we use today.  
Specifically, ""eke name"" was altered into ""a neke name"" as a result of the wrong division. 
Additionally, the Middle English suffix ""-ik"" or ""-ick"" is a related word-forming element that denotes having the nature of or being associated with something."

is there any word for the opposite of a bug in programming?,"To address a programming error, one might make efforts to correct it with a ""fix"", often achieved through patching or debugging efforts, where changes are applied to improve software by removing the underlying issues.  Unintentional but beneficial occurrences in software are sometimes embraced by users as ""Easter Eggs"", despite being accidental and not clearly visible at first glance. 
In the realm of gaming, a distinction is made between ""glitches"", which beneficially allow players to perform actions they technically should not be able to, and bugs, which are unwanted programming errors.  
The term ""unintended feature"" is applied to beneficial aspects of software that were not planned, which can be regarded positively by users but were never intentionally designed as parts of the system. 
The expression ""happy accident"" may also be used to describe these fortunate mishaps that yield positive results. 
Meanwhile, some users refer to these unforeseen bonuses as ""magic,"" emphasizing the unexpected and inexplicable nature of their functioning, while black magic would be a technique that works, though nobody really understands why.  
Additionally, software development jargon includes terms like ""misbug,"" which describes unintentional software properties that end up being useful, and ""featurebug,"" a blend of feature and bug, indicating a function that should not operate as it does, yet is still beneficial."

Modesty can be described as the personality trait or behavior of not flaunting oneself; a person is modest when they do not boast or brag.

simply not vs. not simply,"The term ""simply"" when utilized as an adverb before a verb or as an adverb adjective, serves to strengthen a statement.  
For example, characterizing an occurrence as ""simply marvellous"" or stating something ""simply cannot be justified"" uses ""simply"" as a pragmatic marker impacting the entire statement.  
In contrast, ""simply"" can also function as a traditional adverb meaning ""in a simple way"" or ""merely,"" which is more closely positioned to the verb it modifies.  
So, in the context of the phrase ""One simply does not walk into Mordor"", ""simply"" modifies ""does not"", conveying the absolute impossibility of the action.  
Conversely, ""One does not simply walk into Mordor"" places ""simply"" in relation to ""walk,"" suggesting that while walking alone is insufficient, alternative complex methods could potentially lead to successful entry."
are so and so that interchangeable?,"The word 'so' and the phrase 'so that' hold distinct meanings and are not interchangeable.  
'So' can convey an extent, a conclusion, or introduce a statement, but it does not directly imply intent as 'so that' does.  
In contrast, 'so that' specifically implies a purpose or an intention.  
So, while 'so' can be used ambiguously, 'so that' is unambiguous and cannot be replaced with 'so' without altering the sentence's meaning.  
Therefore, it is crucial to understand the difference to use them correctly, as 'so' often results in a conclusion already known, and 'so that' suggests actions taken to cause or prevent a future occurrence."

answer how is it going?,"Typical responses to the question ""How's it going?"" include: ""Good,"" ""Fine,"" ""Okay,"" and rarely is it answered with ""bad"" since this question is usually simply a formality.  
Technically, it would be incorrect grammar to say ""going good"" and you should use: ""It is going well"", ""Going well"", ""Very well, thanks"", or ""Fine, and you""? 
Variations may come in the form of ""Not bad,"" ""Could be worse,"" or simply ""Not bad, you?"" which adds a layer of interaction by returning the question back to the inquirer.  
In different English-speaking regions, responses can range from a mumbled ""ok"" to an enthusiastic ""great"" or ""wonderful"", or an honest overview of one's current health situation.  
Some people may also respond with just ""Good, you?"" acknowledging the questioner but keeping the interaction brief.  
It's generally acceptable to use ""fine,"" ""well,"" or ""good, how about you?"" as these customary responses are widely understood to be sufficient for such exchanges, though deviations such as ""All right, how about you?"" are also typical."

unregister vs deregister,"The terms ""deregister"" and ""unregister"" are seen as synonyms. 
Indeed, programmers often utilize these terms interchangeably. 
However, in the context of technological use, particularly programming, ""unregister"" is more commonly used; however, ""deregister"" carries a more active implication, suggesting additional cancelations beyond just a removal from a list. 
That is to say, the act of unregistering is associated with undoing a registration that should not have occurred, whereas deregistering implies the removal of a registration that is possibly no longer valid. 
Finally, a common understanding is that ""unregistered"" means merely not registered, while ""deregistered"" implies active removal from a registration list."

In contrast, a ""key"" indicates that the items it lists are specific, just as symbols might denote particular museums on a map.

why giraffe as a name for the animal?,"The term ""Giraffe"" is derived from the Arabic word ""Gyraffa"" and the Italian term ""Giraffa"".  
Historically, the animal was called a ""Camelopard,"" a term believed to be less accurate as it crudely combined features of a camel and leopard.  
The ancient name of ""Zerapha"", corrupted by us into ""giraffe"", is 
 also a fitting explanation. 
The adoption of the term ""giraffe"" coincides with the emergence of the word in English translations of Italian works in the late 16th century.  
This new term gained popularity over ""camelopard"" in scientific and naturalist texts, reflecting a shift towards more precise language in the study of the animal.  
The transition from ""camelopard"" to ""giraffe"" was gradual, but by the 19th century, ""giraffe"" became the more common term, especially in academia."

meaning of “give a pony”,"The phrase ""give each of us a pony"" suggests an expectation or desire for something luxurious and unattainable, akin to wishing for a Jaguar, yacht, or swimming pool. 
It is often used humorously in response to overly ambitious requests or when discussing extravagant desires.

In American culture, children, especially little girls, may dream of receiving a pony as an ultimate gift, though this is widely recognized as impractical for the average family.

origin of the beatings will continue until morale improves,"Morale is likely the key word of the expression which has a few variants, such as ""The firings/floggings/beatings will continue until morale improves”. 
The saying may have originated in the navy with earliest documented usage according to the Dictionary of Military and Naval Quotations by Robert Debs Heinl from 1966, which mentioned no liberty being granted on a ship until morale improved.  
The phrase's possible military origin is supported by another entry in the same dictionary and the appearance of a related cartoon in a magazine published by the US Bureau of Naval Personnel in November 1961.  
Additionally, a cartoon by Lt B.E. Lodge of the US Navy published in 1961 features a caption about liberty being canceled until morale improves, which also supports a naval origin for the expression."

singular of dice,"The term ""die"" is the correct singular form used instead of ""dice,"" as historically and commonly recognized in formal writing.  
Though some dictionaries and sources mention that ""dice"" can be singular or plural, resulting in some ambiguity, ""die"" remains the preferred term and is supported by various dictionary definitions.

the difference between an analogy and a metaphor?,"Analogy is logically consistent whereas a metaphor is emotionally consistent, though one does not exclude the other.  
A metaphor is one kind of analogy frequently employed for their emotional impact or for illustrative purposes in literature and also for comparisons, while analogies serve as a practical problem-solving tool.  
An analogy is specifically a discursive or argumentative technique; as opposed to a metaphor that is strictly a literary one designed to evoke emotions or create a vivid image.  
Analogy is a perceived likeness between two entities, whereas metaphor is one “figure of speech” which you might use to communicate that likeness.  
When considering an analogy as a documentary, metaphor can be likened to fictionalization.  
Finally, a metaphor is an implicit simile, while analogy is an explicit one. 
Or, a metaphor is literally false, while an analogy is literally true."

"none of us is vs none of us are, which is correct?","Based on Oxford Online Dictionaries, it's acceptable to employ either a singular or plural verb with 'none' as it has historically been used with both depending on the context.

what is the difference between name and title?,"Some say that ""title"" is perceived as something graphical, which suggests that it has a visual aspect, like being written in bold and a larger font, such as on a gallery picture or a book cover and that ""name"" is deemed broader in context and usage, implying it can replace a title in many instances. 
Others contend that a ""name"" typically identifies something specific, a ""title"" is associated with a role or requirement, even though the terms can overlap, such as with books and songs. 
Titles can sometimes act as names, and this is often true in the context of books, films, or songs, where the title can be used as the name, or a more 'familiar' name might be derived from the title or its content. 
Regarding linguistic roots, ""name"" derives from Germanic origin, whereas ""title"" comes from French and often signals a higher level of respect when used; choosing to use ""title"" over ""name"" suggests a respectful elevation.  
In contrast, using a ""name"" suggests a more practical and direct relationship with the subject."

english word equivalent of 膩 (sick of something due to overindulgence),"There are many English word equivalents for 膩, being sick of something due to overindulgence. 
To begin with, the term ""to surfeit"" refers to indulging to excess in anything, such as an excess of music leading to a loss of appetite as depicted in Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"", and can be used interchangeably with ""sated"".  
In colloquial English, expressions such as feeling ""sick"" or ""tired"" of something convey a sense of overindulgence similar to the concept of surfeit but are not restricted only to situations of excess.  
The Latin phrase ""ad nauseam"" implies something done to a sickening or excessive degree and is commonly understood in English.  
In some dialects, the verb ""founder"" denotes consuming until one falls ill, which can apply to situations like a dog overeating.  
""Gorged"" suggests eating to a distasteful excess, while a ""binge"" can refer to overindulgence in activities such as watching television marathons.  
The colloquial term ""fatigue,"" like steak-fatigue, also indicates weariness due to repetition.  
To describe overeating, ""engorged,"" ""stuffed,"" and ""full"" are used, with ""engorged"" having a particularly negative connotation.  
Phrases like ""coffeed out,"" ""burned out,"" or ""fried"" express an excessiveness that may not be strictly related to physical satiety but rather to a state of being overwhelmed or fed up with something.  
And finally, the terms ""blasé"" or ""jaded"" indicate a lack of enthusiasm, which may stem from overexposure or overindulgence."

is there an extended backus–naur form (ebnf) that covers all of english?,"The linguistic literature has established that natural human languages, including English, are not confined to context-free grammar.

However, it's observed that there are exceptions and the parsing algorithm may require additional structures to track certain permutations, which could extend beyond the strict confines of context-free constructions, making it most likely incomplete."

is there a word for air can pass through it?,"The term ""breathable"" is widely accepted in the industry for describing something that allows air to pass through, despite being perceived as an ugly and misleading word. 
Fabrics or materials with small pores that allow liquids or gases to move through are called ""permeable"" or ""penetrable,"" while ""porous"" is another term used for materials like rocks that have tiny spaces allowing air or liquids to pass. 
Additionally, ""breathability"" refers to a fabric's ability to let moisture vapor through, while ""air permeability"" indicates its capacity to let air through. 
Although there is no specific term for describing a screen door as ""breathable,"" the concept of air passing through is inherent in the nature of screen doors. 
The term ""perforated"" applies to surfaces that have holes allowing fluid or gas passage and can apply to screen doors or membranes. 
When depicting something that is not completely sealed against air, ""not airtight"" is apt. 
A more technical term might be ""transpirable,"" suggesting a substance allows fluids or gas to pass through. 
If the context aligns, ""aerated"" might be used to describe something that has been exposed to air and is allowing passage of air. 
Inventive terms like ""transaerodynamic"" or ""aerolucid"" imply an easy passage of air although these terms are not standard. 
""AIR-LOOSE"" describes something that is not sealed tightly. 
To describe a fabric's or a screen's property of airflow, ""mesh"" or ""vented"" is suitable. 
An ethereal quality could be ascribed to something that has a light or delicate characteristic. 
The word ""aspiratory"" pertains to breathing and thus could be used for describing something that allows air to pass. 
For technical texts, ""air-permeable"" has been historically used. 
A common term in English is ""non-airtight,"" but from an HVAC perspective, ""diffuser"" might be a term that appropriately applies."

difference between computation and calculation,"The term ""calculation"" is most commonly associated with processes that are strictly arithmetic, with no repetition or selection, such as something that might be done with a calculator, while ""computation"" often entails applying specific rules in a systematic way, as might be done on a computer. 
For example, a calculation can be something as straightforward as figuring out your mortgage payment, whereas a computation might involve determining something as complex as your actuarial health risk. 
Computation is generally a more involved and lengthy process, not necessarily limited to numeric tasks, and has historically been linked to more complex undertakings like a Turing-complete program. 
Although those distinctions appear to be the consensus, some outliers argue that the term ""calculate"" should involve algebraic or calculus operations, in contrast to ""compute,"" which should indicate simple arithmetic, reflecting the historical origins and etymological nuances of the words."

why are greek letters pronounced incorrectly in scientific english?,"The pronunciation of Greek letters has been influenced by Latin and it's probable that Latin influenced the pronunciation of β.  
The scientific pronunciation is based on the Classical Greek pronunciation, rather than their Modern Greek equivalents.  
Insights into Ancient Greek phonology suggest it differed substantially from the modern language.  
Moreover, the transition of Greek through Latin into English and other languages is highlighted as well as undergoing the Great Vowel Shift, noting that pronunciations have altered across this linguistic journey.  
The English pronunciation of Greek letters draws on reconstructions of the Classical Greek pronunciation by scholars like Erasmus and further underwent some change along with English during the Great Vowel Shift, and a re-reconstruction in the mid-19th century brought it incompletely back in line with Ancient Greek."

are a handful or is a handful?,"One opinion is that with a singular noun like ""handful,"" it's proper to use a plural verb with it.  
Similarly, when describing an amount using a singular noun such as ""a handful,"" ""a pack,"" or ""a group,"" you would still use a plural verb since these nouns represent an undefined number of items or individuals.  
Both can be correct, take for example ""a handful of apples"" or ""a pack of wolves""—despite the singular noun, we talk about them as a collection, thus requiring a plural verb.  
However, with non-countable nouns like ""sand"" as in a ""handful of sand"", you would use a singular verb."

"It is unclear why the helicopter carrying Lionel Zinsou crash-landed in a stadium. My father is fine. There were no victims in the helicopter accident in Djougou, Marie-Cecile Zinsou tweeted. Earlier this month, Mr Zinsou confirmed he would run as a candidate in Benin's 2016 presidential elections. The helicopter crashed while landing at a stadium in the city of Djougou, a spokesman for Benin's interior ministry Leonce Houngbadji told the AFP news agency. He said no-one in the helicopter was hurt. Mr Zinsou, a former private-equity executive, was appointed prime minister of Benin in June. He has said he will run for president in February's election as a candidate of the ruling Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE) party.

using and at the beginning of a sentence,"It is perfectly all right to begin a sentence with a conjunction; It is a special form of emphasis, used to elevate a clause to a position of more influence and importance.  
However, some argue that it is not usually considered good practice to begin sentences with conjunction because a sentence that would begin with ""and"" or ""but"" generally connects well enough with the previous sentence that it should connect to it rather than becoming its independent sentence.  
Others say that not using conjunctions to start sentences unnecessarily removes a versatile option from the writer's toolkit, and there is a persistent belief that it is improper to begin a sentence with 'And,' but this prohibition has been cheerfully ignored by standard authors from Anglo-Saxon times onwards.  
Writers might use ""And"" at the beginning of sentences in novels to emphasize a point or to mimic informal speech, as it sometimes adds depth to the narrative that might be lost if the sentences were combined.  
Additionally, the conjunction ""And"" can make the link between complex thoughts less cumbersome and is sometimes used in speech writing for its ability to make transitions smoother; Yet this kind of conjunction at the beginning of a sentence can sometimes be unnecessary, and a more concise writer might eliminate it for brevity."

is it focus or concentration?,"The terms focus and concentration are used in a way that emphasizes their similarity, essentially as a form of tautological repetition to enhance their importance. 
Technically, focus refers to how broad the range of attention is, whereas concentration relates to the depth or intensity of that attention. 
Sometimes focus and concentration are so similarly applied that they can appear synonymous. 
Focus can also indicate the object of one's attention, while concentration often pertains to the sustained effort during mental activities. 
The act of focusing narrows down attention, but concentration maintains that focus over time. 
Within the realm of mental activity, focus is the allocation of mental energy to a particular task, whereas concentration involves sustaining that focus over the time required to complete the task, effectively making focus a component of concentration."

is it technically correct to call an almond drink milk in english?,"The term ""milk"" has been used by English speakers to describe white liquids since Old English, and this use extends to various substances like the sap of a spurge or fish semen.  
It is, therefore, linguistically acceptable to refer to nut milks as ""milk"" in English.  
However, the scientific and legal definitions of ""milk"" specify it as a secretion from mammals' mammary glands with a particular composition, which does not include plant-based liquids, and is subject to strict regulations.  
But in the United States specifically, FDA regulations technically prohibit the labeling of plant-based products as ""milk"" or ""cheese,"" though enforcement has been lax; recent studies by the FDA are looking into public perceptions of these terms.  
And further to this, the European Union also mandates that milk must originate from animals, with certain exemptions varying by country, and subsequent interpretations differing even among member states."

on website or at website?,"When referring to a website as a site located on the web, the preposition ""at"" would be most fitting. 
Conversely, if one interprets a website as a page on the web, then ""on"" becomes the appropriate preposition to use. 
""On"" is also appropriate when referencing the location of data, like a journal paper that is accessible by visiting a particular website. 
If instead one is referring to their location via a specific web address, ""at"" would be the proper term. 
And among computer experts, there may be a tendency to use ""on"" due to the technical understanding of websites as collections of files stored on servers. 
However, in more general conversations, the preposition ""at"" might be more commonly adopted."

a term for ads masquerading as independent journalism,"The term ""infomercial"" is a blend of ""information"" and ""commercial,"" typically used in North America to refer to an advertising film that promotes a product in a style that is both informative and ostensibly objective.

Conversely, the written word in print or online media that aims to promote within an editorial format is generally referred to as ""advertorial"".

"Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK) said there had been a particular rise in the scam in the last few weeks. Several small or medium-sized companies in the UK have lost sums of between Â£10,000 and Â£20,000 as a result.

proficient what is the correct usage?,"When discussing proficiency, ""in"" is commonly applied to subject areas, such as being proficient in science or auto mechanics.  
The expression ""proficient in a"" tends to be used more frequently in comparison to other prepositional phrases. 
The general case with ""proficient"" with this use of ""in"" is that the ""proficient in"" can't take just any clause or phrase as its object; it has to at least be some activity that is learnable and repeatable. 
The term ""proficient with"" is more appropriately used when referring to proficiency with tools, like being proficient with a hammer or a violin.  
Lastly, ""proficient at"" is usually reserved for specific activities, exemplified by expressions like proficient at swimming or proficient at building houses."

why is the ph pronounced like a v in stephen? is this the only word like that?,"The name Stephen likely entered English via Spanish, as suggested by its spelling ""Stephen"" instead of ""Esteban"", reflecting the Spanish pronunciation of 'b' which sounds between English 'V' and 'B'.  
In Hungarian it is spelt 'Istvan', so there's another possible source. 
In English, the pronunciation of Stephen with a 'v' sound could be due to a historical voicing of the intervocalic , a process also seen in the word evolution from 'loaf' to 'loaves', with the 'ph' in Stephen being retained or restored to reflect its Greek origins.  
The pronunciation of 'ph' as 'v' is present in British English, particularly in the word 'nephew', which can be pronounced as 'nev-yoo'.  
Additionally, in certain dialects, such as in Essex, England, 'nephew' and place names like 'Bulphan' are pronounced with a 'v' sound.  
Finally, the existence of both 'phial' and 'vial' in English with different pronunciations, despite a shared Greek origin of the 'ph', indicates variations in phonetic interpretations over time."

what is a room a company provides for eating food called?,"There are many terms used for a room a company provides for eating food. 
To start, a room where employees can take breaks is commonly known as a ""breakroom"" or ""break room"".

In more corporate or formal environments, one might hear ""refectory"" in the UK, which carries a slightly old-fashioned or academic connotation.  
However, in less formal contexts or when the space resembles a conventional home kitchen, it might simply be called a ""kitchen"".  
Furthermore, the term ""commissary"" is used in North America to describe a restaurant within a movie studio, military base, or similar institutions."

"The Robins have won six of their 10 League One games since former Brighton Under-21 and reserves coach Williams took interim charge in December. The 35-year-old replaced Martin Ling at the County Ground, after Ling stepped down citing health reasons. He is a fantastic coach, the best I've come across in 25 years of football, chairman Lee Power said. The reason Luke is 'head coach' and not 'manager' is because that is what he is: the head coach. No players will come into the club that Luke is not happy with, but his main job is to coach the group and improve them. Williams is the fourth person to take charge of Swindon this season, following Mark Cooper, Ling, and chairman Power, who looked after the first team for a spell following Cooper's dismissal in October.

what is the correct plural of training?,"Native English speakers typically use ""training"" as an uncountable noun, meaning it does not have a plural form. 
However, there are instances where ""training"" is used in the plural form ""trainings,"" especially when referring to specific training events.

is there an equivalent term to cold turkey for starting something instead of quitting something?,"The word ""suddenly"" conveys an abrupt or immediate action, as seen in a passage from a Mark Twain story that describes a swift change in plans.  
Various idioms depict quickly engaging in actions, like ""jump in with both feet"" or ""dive in at the deep end"", suggesting full commitment without hesitation.  ""Whole hog"" signifies going all-in with an activity similar to ""from a standing start,"" which means beginning something without prior momentum, although it may not always be suitable.  
An overzealous approach to new endeavors can be described as ""going overboard"" or ""throwing yourself into something"". 
The phrase ""hit the ground running"" also suggests an energetic start.  
Actions taken ""out of the blue"" are unexpected and random, as if they appeared ""out of nowhere"", or ""out of a clear blue sky"".  
A person who restarts an activity after a break may do so ""off the couch,"" indicating a sudden return.  
Committing to an endeavor with the utmost intensity is expressed as going at it ""full tilt"", and facing a challenge head-on might be described as ""biting the bullet"". 
One may deal with a situation directly by ""taking the bull by the horns"".  
An immediate action or decision with little to no warning can be phrased as ""just like that"". 
Furthermore, starting completely anew, building from the ground up, is referred to as beginning ""from scratch""."

american vs. british english: meaning of one hundred and fifty,"In standard numerical language, the term ""one hundred fifty"" should denote the number 150, rather than ""one hundred and fifty,"" which suggests the inclusion of a decimal or fractional part. 
In spoken American English, the word ""and"" is not always indicative of a decimal point; however, it is considered superfluous and should be omitted. 
The term ""one fifty"" may be used, but can indicate both 150 and the decimal 1.50, leading to possible confusion.

what does it mean when a guy calls u sunshine?,"The term ""sunshine"" can convey various meanings based on context and intonation; for example, it can reflect a threat, or alternatively, it can signify a person who is always smiling, happy, and warm like a ray of sun.  
It may also be used sarcastically to imply the opposite to mean a person who is not warm or happy.  
In some relationships, being called ""sunshine"" can intimate that the person holds a special place in the speaker's heart.

Also, it can be used ironically referring to someone as a supposed ""source of joy"".  
In UK contexts, it's often a sarcastic remark having a negative allusion to bright and the lack of intelligence of the target, but it can also be used light-heartedly or as a term of comic endearment."

"what is the difference between taking courses, classes or lessons?","In academic contexts, the term ""class"" generally refers to individual sessions where instruction is given, while ""course"" encompasses a series of these classes, typically offering a comprehensive exploration of a subject.

Additionally, in North American English, a ""course"" might mean a series of classes over a semester, and the use of ""lesson"" is less frequent and might be limited to individual instruction situations, like piano lesson. 
To generally summarize the relationships using common definitions, a lesson is a component of a class, a class is a segment of a course, and a course is a part of an academic program leading to a certification.

"A report by NHS Shetland has suggested the move, in a bid to curb excessive drinking. About three-quarters of all alcohol consumed in Scotland is now bought from supermarkets or off licences. The proposal will be considered by the local licensing board after the council elections next year. Elizabeth Robinson, one of the report authors from NHS Shetland, told BBC Scotland: People with alcohol problems have told us that they can go out the next morning and buy alcohol at 10am. If there was just a bit of a longer break until some time in the afternoon that would really help them. You can buy your 14 units a week for about Â£3 in Shetland. People tend to pour larger drinks at home. However, shopkeeper Jordan Thomason said: I think such a drastic increase in time runs the risk of people buying too much alcohol and then it could have the opposite effect of what they are trying to do.",A proposal that supermarkets and off licences should only be able to sell alcohol later in the day is to be considered in Shetland.

how to avoid ambiguity in i am renting an apartment in new york?,"Firstly, a tenant ""rents an apartment"" and a landlord too, but to make the distinction clear landlords can use the verb ""rent out"". 
So, a landlord might say, ""I own an apartment (room/house/complex) that I am renting out in New York"". 
A landlord might also say, ""I have/own an apartment for rent in New York"". 
Meanwhile, the tenant might say, ""I am renting an apartment"" or ""I'm living in a rental apartment in New York"".  
Furthermore, ""I am staying at a rented apartment"" shows you are a tenant"". 
If you are looking for an apartment as a tenant you would need it ""for rent"". 
Added to these verbs the tenant can be indefinite and refer to ""an apartment"", while the landlord can be indefinite and say ""my apartment. 
Landlords can also ""let"", ""sublet"" and ""lease"" properties, hence: ""I am letting an apartment"" or ""I have an apartment to let"".  
However, this could also be used by tenants with a different preposition, for example you could let a flat from the owner to let a flat to tenants. 
Similarly, the tenants rent ""from"" the landlord and the landlord rents ""to"" the tenants."

why does “attach” have two ts but “detach” only one?,"The words ""attach"" and ""detach"" originate from two distinct Old French terms—'attacher' and 'detacher' (earlier 'destachier').

Moreover, 'detacher' is a term derived from 'attacher' within Old French itself, which is to say 'detacher' was created after 'attacher' in the Old French language."

why does polly want a cracker?,"There is no concrete proof of the exact origin of the phrase ""Polly want a cracker""."
how do native english speakers respond to thank you?,"Phrases such as ""Not at all,"" ""Don't mention it,"" and ""No problem"" are often used interchangeably in response to thanks, indicating that the action was not a hassle. 
""My pleasure"" is particularly used to show that one was happy to assist, typically in a customer service context, and ""You're welcome"" can imply that the action required some effort. 
In some cases, people might respond simply with a ""thank you"" back, ""OK,"" ""It was nothing,"" or nothing at all, indicating that no specific response is required. 
One study suggests that saying ""no problem"" could be perceived as deeming the thanker's issue insignificant, but in reality, most expressions of thanks are sincere and meant to show appreciation. 
Common responses also include ""You're welcome,"" ""Not a problem,"" ""Not at all,"" ""No trouble at all,""  ""Don't mention it,"" ""It was my pleasure,"" ""Certainly,"" ""Anytime,"" ""Sure,"" ""Of course,"" ""Happy to,"" and ""No worries,"" which are casual and widely accepted. 
In the UK, responses to ""thank you"" vary, with some finding ""You're welcome"" grating and ""No problem"" bothersome, preferring alternatives like ""Not at all"" or ""My pleasure."" 
Interestingly, some acknowledge thanks purely with a nod or smile, or by saying 'You would do the same for me,' both of which are considered acceptable."

polite alternatives to as soon as possible,"When requesting a prompt response, expressions such as ""at your earliest convenience,"" when you get a chance"", or ""as soon as possible"" can sometimes be vague or misunderstood, as it may imply completing a task when it best suits the individual.  
Similarly, requesting something ""asap"" or ""at the earliest"" is a common and polite way to convey urgency in business communication, as is the verb expedite.  
""As soon as you get a chance"" is another option that balances respect for the recipient's time with the sender's need for expedience.  
Providing a specific date can also help prioritize tasks and accommodate both parties' schedules effectively.  
You could also phrase it as ""as soon as you (possibly) can"" to maintain a polite tone. 
Emphasizing the importance of quick action with expressions like ""your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated"" or requesting an immediate response is a formal approach to indicate urgency while retaining politeness."

what is the difference between english teacher and teacher of english?,"When you emphasize ""teacher"" in ""English teacher,"" it refers specifically to a teacher from England. 
Conversely, placing the emphasis on ""English"" means that the individual teaches the English language.  
Moreover, anyone who teaches English can be described as a ""teacher of English,"" regardless of their background.  
However, an ""English teacher"" typically refers to someone who is part of the education system, is salaried, and teaches a classroom of students. 
In terms of explicit content, ""teacher of English"" signifies that the person's role is to teach the English subject, and this term is used regardless of the teacher's nationality.  
Meanwhile, ""English teacher"" might be interpreted as either related to teaching English or to being of English nationality, if not clearly defined by the context."

“between” vs. “among”,"Between should be used when referring to a one-to-one relationship among two specified entities.  
However, it is also correct to use between when more than two entities are involved in one-to-one relationships.  
Conversely, among is appropriate when considering entities as a collective group. 
Between is also preferred when expressing the notion of being in the middle of two specific points, even when the number of participants is unspecified. 
Grammar experts assert that between has been used for more than two entities since Old English.  
Usage arguments suggest that between is appropriate for individual items, regardless of quantity, while among is for non-distinct items or groups.  
Certain myths surrounding the usage of between relate to the false notion that it should only be applied to two items, with among being reserved for more than two.  
Usage has evolved, and modern English accepts between in scenarios involving more than two specific entities or points in time or space."

does either a or b preclude both a and b?,"The term ""either/or"" typically signifies choosing between two distinct options, either one or the other, and not both. 
It often means one option is viable to the exclusion of the other. 
When discussing options, it is sometimes intended to stress that there are strictly two possibilities. 
In the context of ""either A or B,"" it generally means choosing one and not both, but it can depend on context. 
Likewise, ""either A or B"" in everyday language tends to adopt the exclusive sense but mathematically is inclusive unless context dictates otherwise.  
While ""either A or B"" might not strictly rule out the possibility of ""A and B,"" it generally leans towards an exclusive or rather than inclusive."

what is the difference between best of luck and all the best?,"The phrase ""all the best"" is often used more as a farewell gesture with an undertone of finality, suggesting a significant period of time may elapse before seeing each other again, while ""best of luck"" is used without this implication of parting and can be said in situations with immediate outcomes.  
""All the best' is seen as a term conveying respect, and ""best of luck"" as more friendly or casual.  
Additionally, ""best of luck"" tends to be related to specific events, and ""all the best"" is more general well-wishing for the future or when the next meeting is uncertain.

what is an appropriate response to whats up greeting?,"A common reply to ""What's up?"" can be as simple as ""not much"" or ""not too much"".  
In a more casual interaction, it's also acceptable to respond with ""hey (man/dude)"" or the shorthand ""sup"".  
If you perceive the ask is for a well-being update and you're feeling positive, ""Yeh, I'm good"" is an appropriate answer.  
If there isn't anything special occurring at the moment, you might say ""Not much, how about you?"".  
In response to the greeting, you might also express gratitude or satisfaction with your situation by saying ""Thank God, I am doing well,"" or, if feeling less than ideal, ""Unfortunately, I'm not doing so well today"".  
Some may prefer the more relaxed ""Stuff, y'know,"" indicating the routine of daily life.

Another appropriate response to replicate the style of the greeting would be ""Not much, how about with you?""."
is there a gender neutral equivalent of “manspreading”?,"The term ""manspreading"" bears a specific cultural connotation connected to gender entitlement and power dynamics, which is not captured by alternative terms, however, some have been suggested. 
One option is describing the seated person as ""legs akimbo,"" a posture where the knees are bent and protrude outward from the trunk, while the verb ""sprawled out"" indicates a stretched or spread out position that may come off as unnatural or ungraceful and may be intrusive on others' personal space. 
""Knee-spreading"" is another gender-neutral term that captures the essence of sitting with legs spread far apart. 
""Seat hog"" or ""space hog"" is a pejorative term that describes an individual who selfishly occupies more seating space than necessary, and these terms can be used in contexts such as public transportation to encourage proper seating etiquette. 
One Slate writer used ""legroom-encroaching jerk"" to suggest a person who invades others' personal space, particularly in the context of traveling on public transportation."

number agreement when using “(s)” for optional plural,"When dealing with terms that could be either singular or plural, it's necessary to adjust the surrounding context to ensure proper agreement in number; for instance, appropriately switching between ""the award(s) is (are) accounted for"".

Moreover, the plural form is inclusive of the singular, as it is understood to mean ""one object or several objects,"" thus covering all quantity possibilities without the need for complications introduced by parentheses."

what does great good mean in the tutorial title learn you a haskell for great good!?,"The phrase in question may be intentionally incorrect and likely derives from Baron Sacha Cohen's comedy, particularly his character Borat. 
It also might mock the phrase ""For great justice!"" which is notoriously associated with a poorly-translated video game called Zero Wing. 
Some sources say the phrasing's origins can be traced back to a Haskell tutorial titled ""Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 hours"", which blends the meme of ""Teach yourself X in 21 days"" books with Peter Norvig's satirical ""Teach yourself programming in 10 years"". 
This joke seems to resonate with the Haskell programming community, making fun of the language's functional programming style. 
However, some interpret the phrase as analogous to ""for the Greater Good"", suggesting an underlying message that learning Haskell is beneficial to the world. 
Others interpret the phrase ""Learn Haskell for great benefit"" as a simplified, more grammatical version of a Haskell tutorial title, serving to alleviate the fears associated with Haskell's mathematical nature and promise a less pedantic and formal approach to the subject."

euphemism for diarrhea,"An ""upset stomach"" typically points to discomfort in the digestive tract, manifesting as heartburn, nausea, or indigestion, and may lead to symptoms such as bloating or diarrhea.  
When communicating about sickness at work, it is often acceptable to convey the illness using non-specific terms like ""upset stomach"", ""loose motion"", or ""the runs"" to maintain professionalism without providing explicit details.  
For instance, referring to it as ""having a bug"" can be clear enough, and sometimes just indicating that one is too ill to work and ""needs to stay near a toilet"" is sufficient.  
Other expressions include a ""bout of the gastro"" or a ""tummy bug"".  
The Medical Dictionary defines ""alvine flux"" as simple diarrhea and ""alvine movements"" can be another way to phrase it.  
""The trots"" is also informally recognized as diarrhea.  
A ""D and V bug"" in British English signifies diarrhea and vomiting, usually linked to Norovirus or other infections.  
Common euphemisms like ""Montezuma's revenge"", ""curry-in-a-hurry"", or a bout of ""gastrointestinal distress"" are sometimes used to describe these symptoms without overly explicit language.  
If the illness is related to travel, geographical-specific terms like ""Montezuma's Revenge"", ""Gyppy Tummy"" or ""Gandhi's Revenge"" may be used humorously.  
Finally, the term ""stomach bug"" is a widely recognized euphemism for diarrhea, seen as less graphic than other more direct or playful expressions."

One opinion is that it depends on what region you are from in the US, for example, in the Midwest, ""slacks"" refers to casual dress pants suitable for work or social gatherings, distinguishing them from more informal garments like jeans."

what is it when someone answers a question with a question?,"The act of responding to a question with another question can be referred to as ""counter-questioning"", also known as maieutics.  
Various rhetorical devices such as erotema, anacoenosis, anthypophora, dianoea, aporia, epiplexis, exuscitatio, pysma, and ratiocinatio relate to this kind of dialogue, especially when the follow-up question challenges the initial one or seeks to clarify and delve deeper into the subject matter."
money vs monies,"The term ""money"" is generally considered more logical and is the preferred form, whereas ""monies"" is a variant that's often seen.  
The use of ""monies"" specifically refers to the plural form of money, which is typically utilized in a financial context.  
On the other hand, ""money"" is used in collective senses, for example when referring to a sum made from a deal.  
However, if there's a need to highlight that funds are sourced from various places, ""moneys"" or ""monies"" is more appropriate.  
In instances where there are multiple occurrences of money, ""monies"" can be used."

"Michael Ryan made the comments in an interview with the Bloomberg financial news service. In October, the Quebec state government pumped $1bn (£655m) into a partnership set up to complete the CSeries. The wings for the CSeries are made in Northern Ireland. The quid pro quo was that final assembly and marketing would stay in Quebec, but that was all, Mr Ryan said. The CSeries will employ at least 800 people in Belfast at full production, out of 5,500 in total. Mr Ryan told Bloomberg that the Northern Ireland plant had skills in composite manufacturing that made it a world leader in wing production, safeguarding its status. The development of the narrow-bodied CSeries passenger plane has placed a major strain on Bombardier's finances. The project has been repeatedly delayed, is over-budget and orders have been slow.",The manager of Bombardier's Northern Ireland operation has said the Canadian bailout of the firm's CSeries project poses no threat to the Belfast plant.
man-hour vs. person-hour? is the former now considered politically incorrect?,"The concept of ""man-hours"" is derived from the verb 'to man', which indicates being at a station or assigning to stations, rather than directly referring to gender, and the term ""man hour"" is still preferred by some for its traditional usage. 
However, others argue that ""worker hours"" is a better term as it is less awkward, more inclusive, and conveys the idea of measuring work rather than being gender-specific, and in certain contexts, the term ""man-hour"" may be perceived to be politically incorrect.  
In this case, language offers multiple plausible alternatives to gender-specific terms, reflecting changes in societal values and usage trends."

"A team from America have looked at how ants have evolved and found that the insects had complex underground farms, growing different types of fungi. Not only that, the ants had taken fungus from its natural environment to nests in much drier climates. The fungus couldn't survive without the ants so it is a very early example of agriculture. Agriculture is what we call the practice of farming. Such as preparing soil for growing crops and raising animals for food and other products such as wool. Dr Ted Schultz who specialises in ants and works at the Museum of Natural History said that Ants have established a form of agriculture that provides all the nourishment needed for their societies using a single crop that is resistant to disease, pests and droughts at a scale and level of efficiency that rivals human agriculture. There are many species of farmer ant, over 250 have been found in tropical forests, deserts and grasslands in the Americas and the Caribbean.",Scientists have found out that ants began farming millions of years before humans did.
do u say happy halloween?,"The phrase ""Happy Halloween"" is commonly used on many occasions.  
Many Americans routinely say ""Happy Halloween,"" even though if Halloween were truly horrifying, people would be hiding rather than celebrating.  
Nevertheless, there isn't a specific greeting or farewell associated with Halloween, and while it's becoming more popular to see ""Happy Halloween"" on banners and ads, it's not customary to joyfully proclaim it in everyday interactions.  
Some might find that ""happy"" doesn't quite fit the Halloween theme due to cultural interpretations of the holiday, with different cultures celebrating or remembering the deceased, or marking the change of seasons.  
Nevertheless, ""Happy Halloween"" serves as a greeting to denote a fun aspect of the supposedly non-true holiday."
has took or has taken?,"Took is used as the simple past tense of take, while taken is the past participle in English grammar.

why is wheres it grammatically incorrect?,"In ""Where is it?"", 'is' is the strong form and thus cannot be replaced with the clitic 's. 
The presence of stress in a sentence affects the use of clitics; stress on 'is' makes it unsuitable to be a clitic as it must be able to receive stress in such a context. 
""Where's it?"" does not properly convey the auditory characteristics needed for a question, such as the rising tone that is typically applied at the end of the question. 
The reason ""Where's it?"" ""sounds bad"" is that it doesn't/can't follow the rules for audible questions."

opposite for gold standard for a benchmark of awfulness,"The term ""poster child"" can represent someone or something with unfavorable (or favorable) attributes, and such a person can be considered a prime representative of an ideal or an unfavorable aspect.  
Also, ""benchmark"" is a more neutral term, simply indicating a standard for comparison that could have either a positive or a negative application.  
In discussions of certain qualities, the terms ""touchstone,"" ""epitome,"" and ""nadir"" can be used to indicate a standard or notable example without necessarily implying positivity.  
Meanwhile, a ""de facto standard"" suggests a widely accepted norm or prevalent example, regardless of whether it is considered the best.  
""Lead Standard"" has emerged as a term to denote a standard that is quite poor or detrimental in contrast to the exemplary ""gold standard"".  
The phrase ""plumb new depths"" is utilized to express something that has reached a new, unprecedented low in quality or success.  
Similarly, someone, or something, could be described to have reached ""a low"" and possibly also ""set a low bar"". 
While not commonly used in formal settings, ""brown standard"" has been suggested as a whimsical alternative to ""gold standard"".  
To describe the lowest possible standard, one might use ""bottom of the barrel,"" indicating a lack of better options or an inability to get any worse."

are there any english words pronounced with sounds/syllables that arent part of the spelling?,"The words ""sawing"" and ""drawing"" are pronounced with an /r/ sound that ""isn't part of the spelling"". 
Additionally, the word ""segue"" is a notable example of pronunciation not entirely reflected in its spelling.  
In certain instances, individuals add an L sound to the word 'saw'.  
The British pronunciation of ""lieutenant"" takes an unexpected turn, where it is pronounced with an f: /lɛfˈtɛnənt/. 
The linguistic landscape widens with various consonant insertions, such as ""warsh"" for wash, ""hain't"" for ain't, ""drawring"" for drawing, and ""hampster"" for hamster.  
Another intriguing case is the American pronunciation of ""pizza,"" where it is pronounced with a T (peet'-za). 
The word ""colonel"" is pronounced identically to ""kernel,"" creating a phonetic peculiarity. 
Furthermore, ""nuclear"" is often mispronounced (wrongly!) with an extra syllable in the middle, more like ‘nucular.’ Merriam-Webster Online acknowledges ""mis-ˈchē-vē-əs"" as a nonstandard pronunciation of ""mischievous"".  
Place names also contribute to this linguistic tapestry; for example, ""Edinburgh"" is pronounced (/ˈɛdɪnbərə/), and the Northamptonshire location ""Cogenhoe"" is pronounced /ˈkʊknoʊ/.  
Even seemingly straightforward words like ""both"" undergo variation, with a significant fraction of Americans often pronouncing it as ""bolth""."

"It was found by a submersible vehicle at a depth of around 2.5 miles (4km) off Necker Island. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it was a depth record for an octopod without fins. The creature has already been nicknamed Casper after the cartoon ghost. The octopod lacked pigment cells, giving it its light-coloured appearance. It is almost certainly an undescribed species Michael Vecchione of the NOAA said, calling it a remarkable little octopod.

are clever and smart the same thing?,"A smart person is typically educated and possesses a broad scope of knowledge, which could be derived from formal education or life experiences.  
On the other hand, a clever person is adept at finding solutions to various situations without necessarily having a specific knowledge base, demonstrating practical intelligence.  
While the terms ""smart"" and ""clever"" are virtually identical, in the US, ""clever"" often conveys a sense of ingenuity and originality, while ""smart"" may denote intelligence, well-thought-out ideas or knowledge.  
It's important to note that ""smart"" intrinsically suggests intelligence, while ""clever"" might not always imply intelligence but rather an effective or skillful approach.  
The usage of both terms is evolving, partly due to the introduction of new technology like smart devices."

is it grammatically correct to start a sentence with also?,"Certainly, when continuing a line of thought, using ""Also"" at the beginning of a sentence is correct, provided you limit its use to an informal register.  
All adverbs (also inclusive) can be used at the beginning of a sentence with the proper punctuation.  
Burchfield in Fowler's Modern English Usage suggests avoiding this usage in educated speech, it being considered informal or uneducated by some, and advises against it if one wants to please traditionalists.  
Nonetheless, this usage is very much correct, especially when you are continuing the sentence from the other person.  Some writers prefer to avoid starting sentences with ""Also"" in formal writing, although the structure ""Also + adjective"" is in fact  more prevalent in formal than informal writing.  
Starting a sentence with ""Also"" may be effective for some communicative purposes, but not for others because it just isn't possible to give a single answer to such a general question.  
In conclusion, starting a sentence with ""Also,"" as well as conjunctions like ""And"" or ""But,"" is generally acceptable."
what was the crime described as letting out of ponds during elizabethan england?,"In historical contexts where farming freshwater fish was practiced, draining the water from ponds was a method used by poachers to easily capture a large number of fish at once.

Meanwhile, it is important to note that historically, a pond often referred to an artificial body of water intended for a specific use, like fish farming, which could be valuable for local food supplies. 
As such, reducing the water level in these ponds was a known tactic that facilitated the poaching of fish, aligning with the broader category of poaching."

why is quixotic not quixotic (a proper adjective)?,"Words that are derived from proper nouns often evolve to become independent terms, losing their association with the original person and subsequently their initial capitalization. 
This process of words like ""quixotic"" transitioning from proper adjectives to common ones is influenced by general usage and linguistic evolution, and produces irregularities. 
These irregularities suggest that rules governing capitalization are shaped by dominant trends along with unpredictable deviations."

whats the difference between a picture and an image?,"The term ""image"" on a computer usually refers to any file that is a drawing, picture, photograph or similar visual content in formats such as .png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .bmp, etc. 
Additionally, in other contexts, an image can pertain to an optical appearance or counterpart of an object, such as one formed by reflection, refraction or through an aperture.  
In contrast, as per the Oxford English Dictionary, a picture is a representation on a surface, particularly a work of art, like a painting or drawing; however, some people use ""picture"" to refer more specifically to an actual photograph.  Additionally, the use of the word ""picture"" diverges from ""image"" in that it has wider application: it can connote a scenic or situational representation or film, for example, as in the ""Oscar for Best Picture,"" or describe changing scenarios in expressions like ""the picture has changed."""

what is the difference between maximum and maximal?,"The highest point is referred to as the maximum, and nothing surpasses it, while the term maximum can also mean considerably high but not necessarily the absolute highest.

On the other hand, a maximum element surpasses all others within its set.  
It is crucial to recognize that while every maximum clique indeed exhibits maximal characteristics, the reverse is not always true."

In absoluten Zahlen sind die Einnahmen aber gestiegen: von 200 Millionen Euro im Jahr 2017 auf 270 Millionen im Jahr 2018. Die Bundesfamilienministerin wies auch auf ein statistisches Problem hin: Bisher wird nicht unterschieden, ob ein Elternteil für seine Kinder nicht zahlen kann oder nicht will. Dies möchte Giffey in diesem Jahr ändern, um die Rückgriffsquote wieder zu erhöhen. Sie sei offen, unkonventionelle Wege auszuprobieren, zum Beispiel Kooperation mit Finanzämtern oder Fahrverbote für zahlungsunwillige Elternteile.",Der Staat hat 2018 kaum Unterhaltsvorschuss eingetrieben.

"flora, fauna, robot","A suitable Latin term that encapsulates all the meanings of ""robot"" is ""robotum"".  
Alternatively, ""facta"" correlates well with the concepts of flora and fauna, representing things that are ""made"".  
The term ""automata"" is another logical choice, distinguishing robot-kind from living organisms.  
However, the term ""mecha,"" which is widely recognized in popular culture, particularly in the context of robots and mechanical objects in science fiction, may also be fitting.  
Also, ""machina,"" referring to machines in general and carrying the implication of a genus of robots, serves as an appropriate term, especially considering that robots do not necessarily possess human-like features, which is instead the specific domain of androids."

can genocide be used for the mass murder of disabled people?,"The term ""genocide"" can indeed be used to encompass the mass murder of disabled people.  
It is linguistically logical to extend this term to the killing of those with genetic disabilities as well.

Extending the meaning of ""genocide"" to include mass elimination is generally acceptable, and only specific groups such as linguistic or legal purists may contest this usage."

"Mit 30, 40 oder sogar 50 Jahren - wann der richtige Zeitpunkt für einen Master of Business Administration (MBA) gekommen ist, lässt sich schwer verallgemeinern. Bei uns liegt der Altersdurchschnitt im MBA bei 30 Jahren, sagt Thomas Erler, Director Education an der EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht in Oestrich-Winkel (Hessen). Im Executive MBA (EMBA) liege er etwas höher, inzwischen bei 34 Jahren. Dennoch finden sich in vielen MBA- und vor allem in EMBA-Kursen Teilnehmer, die die 40 bereits überschritten haben. Bei den EMBA-Studierenden ist die Motivation anders. Da geht es weniger um den nächsten Karriereschritt oder um berufliche Um- oder Neuorientierung wie bei den MBA-Teilnehmern, sondern eher um Weiterbildung, um einen berufsbegleitenden Baustein für lebenslanges Lernen, erläutert Erler.

how and when did american spelling supersede british spelling in the us?,"Webster championed several spelling reforms that influenced American English, but only a select number of these reforms gained widespread acceptance.  
The American spelling began to significantly increase in popularity following the 1820s, with a notable shift in dominance seen around or after 1845.  
A substantial factor contributing to the widespread adoption of standardized American English spelling is the expansion of universal public education in the United States.  
The approach to teaching spelling was prescriptive and relied heavily on a limited set of texts, with Webster's dictionary playing a significant role.  
Teachers, endeavoring to achieve a standard form of English, depended on Webster's dictionary amidst the educational landscape that involved students from diverse linguistic backgrounds."

what is the difference between class and course?,"A ""class"" involves engaging in lessons, whereas a ""course"" consists of multiple classes. 
Furthermore, a course is a sequence of lectures or lessons focused on a particular subject, often culminating in a qualification, while a class represents a part of a course. 
When referring to the broadest term of study within a subject, ""course"" is used, which could encompass an entire degree program or be specifically assigned to a subject like First Year English Literature. 
In contrast, a class is more narrowly defined, pertaining to a section of a course delivered by an instructor to a group of students at a scheduled time.  
Looking at the levels of abstraction, ""course"" operates at a macro level and a ""lesson"" at the micro-level, both independent of time and focused on goals—while ""class"" is considered the most tangible, time-bound, and operates at the process level. 
Simplifying further, a lesson forms part of a class, which in turn forms part of a course, and a course typically contributes to a program that may lead to a degree or certification."

"can i use us-american to disambiguate american? if not, what can i use?","Using the term ""US-American"" may not be standard, but it is understandable and perhaps even appropriate when a clear distinction from others in the hemisphere is needed, simply by prefixing ""US"" to the noun, for example, ""US citizens,"" ""US denizens,"" and ""US speakers. 
However, ""US-American"" is not uncommon in Germany, and the expression is perfectly valid in this context.

is there any equivalent for this persian expression ____ is like an unopened watermelon?,"The uncertainty of outcomes in various scenarios can be expressed through phrases such as ""you never can tell"" and ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". 
Decisions can be likened to gambling, as in ""you pays yer money and you takes yer choice"". 
Furthermore, expressions such as ""a lucky dip,"" ""entering uncharted territory,"" or ""a lady or a tiger"" evoke the unpredictable nature of taking chances without knowing the consequences. 
Relationships and opportunities are often seen as risky ventures, compared to a ""crapshoot"" or ""a pig in a poke,"" where the outcome is highly uncertain.  
The real value or the true nature of something might only be revealed through direct experience, akin to ""the proof is in the pudding"" or ""the proof of the pudding is in the eating"", or discovering ""what's behind the (closed) door"", which ""you never know till try"".  
If left untouched then and observing a phenomenon like ""Schrödinger's Cat"" or an ""unopened letter"" the result would not be know. 
A slightly flippant expression from Australia that could be used in these cases, would be ""suck it and see"". 
Finally, common wisdom advises against premature expectations with phrases like ""don't count your chickens before they've hatched""."

"why do we say try and [verb] instead of try to [verb]? (e.g., try and call me tomorrow.)","The phrase ""to try and do something"" is identified as a more optimistic phrasing than ""try to,"" and could be an example of a figure of speech such as the hendiadys, which is using two words joined by a conjunction to mean the one word emphatically, as in conflating effort with accomplishment.  
The expression ""try and"" creates two distinct verb phrases, as opposed to ""try to,"" which forms a single verb phrase.  
The use of ""try and"" may imply the activity of the following verb will be performed, but success is not guaranteed, while ""try to"" can indicate a mere goal or hope.  
The rhythm of stress flows better with ""try and"" and it is easier to say than ""try to"", making it more fluent in spoken English and offering a possible reason for its popularity."

my personal opinion is... is it always pointless to use the words personal and personally?,"The term ""personal"" is commonly used to underscore the private nature of a matter or to highlight a close relationship when describing a friend. 
It can also be used to distinguish a personal opinion from, for example, a professional opinion, as individuals can have multiple opinions on a matter. 
The word can serve as an emphasis signaling that the view expressed is strictly one's own and may not align with others' perspectives. 
In certain speech contexts, ""personal"" might be employed as a tactic of discourse, to assert authority or to compel recognition of one's subjective viewpoint. 
The usage of ""personal"" is not always redundant as it often conveys additional nuances—claims of universality, emotional tones, or particular stresses on subjectivity or concern. 
This usage may also sometimes be used merely out of politeness, especially in British English."

is guess what a question?,"The phrase ""Guess what"" is an imperative statement, compelling someone to guess a particular fact or situation.

how to pluralize state of the union without an additional noun?,"According to some accounts, the correct pluralization of ""State of the Union"" as a title refers to ""States of the Union"" to express multiple entities.  
However, in an alternative view, ""State-of-the-Union"" is seen as a single pseudo-noun which should have the pluralizing ""s"" at the end.  
So, while ""State of the Unions"", a further option, is recognized as appropriate in informal English, primarily in spoken form, it should be noted that this form, ""State of the Unions"", is meant to reflect multiple addresses about the state of a single union.  
Beyond this, in another context, the variation ""State of the Union's"" indicates an attempt to show pluralization of an entire phrase or clause, suggesting approaches like ""State of the Union(s)"", ""(State of the Union)s"", or ""State-of-the-Union's"" for clarity in written form."

what is the difference between its up to you and its down to you?,"""The choice is yours"" is a common understanding when someone says ""It's up to you,"" highlighting the element of personal decision in the matter. 
However, the saying ""It's down to you"" often carries connotations of responsibility or duty, sometimes to the point of implying that a problem or obligation has ultimately become your fault or responsibility due to the lack of alternatives. 
This differentiation in meaning suggests that ""up to you"" denotes a decision to be made, whereas ""down to you"" indicates an action that needs to be taken, with a subtle or explicit emphasis on the weight of that action falling solely on you. 
In some contexts, ""It's down to you"" might signify that you are the last available option, carrying a slightly negative undertone."

The bank said the ECB had given it until 3 October to draw up a plan for reducing non-performing loans. Italian banks are saddled with €360bn (£300bn; $400bn) of bad debt, about a third of the eurozone's total. Monte dei Paschi accounts for €46.9bn of that total.

"Hayne, 28, quit the NFL after just one season to try to play rugby sevens for Fiji in this year's Rio Olympics. The former San Francisco 49er previously played for Paramatta Eels in Australia's National Rugby League. I thought the boys needed a bit of added competition, said Fiji coach Ben Ryan.

what does it mean when someone asks who are you?,"When someone inquires ""Who are you?"", most likely, they are merely seeking your name.  
However, if the situation involves your presence being unexpected or potentially threatening, they may want to know your function or role, like stating ""I am the shop manager"".  
In more social contexts, people are likely to be asking for an introduction and it would be suitable to reply with your name and how you fit into the group, such as ""I'm Joe, Jeff's friend from college"".  
In a professional setting, it is more expected that they want to know your position or role within the professional environment, for instance, ""I'm Joe Smith, the lead programmer on project Y and I work with Mr. Gates's team""."
difference between im fine and im good,"The phrase ""I'm fine"" generally indicates that nothing is particularly wrong, although it doesn't imply that anything is exceptionally good either.  
On the other hand, ""I'm good"" conveys a positive situation that exceeds the usual state of being, suggesting satisfaction and enjoyment of life's current circumstances, with ""I'm good"" also being able to mean being morally sound, this usage increasingly substituting the meaning of being in good health.  
With regard to regional differences, ""I'm good"" may sound characteristically American and its usage is on the rise in British English, albeit informally, with ""I'm fine"" in the UK as a standard response to inquiries about one's wellbeing, whereas ""I'm good"" originally meaning well-behaved, particularly among children. 
However, among younger people, ""I'm good"" might be embraced as a novel alternative to ""I'm fine,"" reflecting a dynamic and evolving language."

There are some signs that, despite the uncertain economic outlook, demand conditions have strengthened a little in recent months, reflecting the impact of solid labour market conditions and historically low borrowing costs, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. Mortgage approvals increased in October, and surveyors report that new buyer enquiries have increased modestly.

what is a term for a server that is functioning 24/7?,"The operational times for certain services can be consistently throughout the day and night, as indicated by the term ""round-the-clock"".  
Systems that are referred to as ""highly available"" are designed to operate continuously without interruption.

what is the difference between clean and clear?,"The term ""clean"" as an adjective encompasses being free from dirt, marks, or stains, morally uncontaminated and pure, as well as having a smooth edge or surface. 
On the other hand, ""clear"" as an adjective implies being easy to perceive, understand, or interpret, free from anything that blemishes or obscures, and lacking any types of obstruction. 
There are subtle differences. 
For instance, ""clear the table"" suggests removing items like plates or papers, whereas ""clean the table"" means to wipe it down. 
When cleaning an object, the goal is to remove anything that dirties it, whereas clearing an object involves removing anything that obscures its visibility. 
Cleaning a room may involve actions such as vacuuming, dusting, and eliminating trash and dirt, whereas clearing a room may refer to organizing items into their appropriate places or may also imply completely emptying the room."

is there a word like apathy but with positive moral connotations?,"There are numerous terms that suggest a state like apathy but with positive moral connotations. 
To begin with, in suggesting a state of tranquility, one might use ""serenity"" to describe a person who is calm and untroubled.

Remaining poised during adversity is often referred to as having ""composure"".

is there any equivalent to this persian proverb? a bad or faulty item should inevitably be kept by its owner,"There are several comparable expressions for the Persian proverb, ""A bad or faulty item should inevitably be kept by its owner."" 
To begin with, a high-maintenance item and low reward can be referred to as a ""white elephant,"" signifying that it's more trouble than it's worth.  
The expression ""sometimes, one man's trash is also another man's trash"" puts a sarcastic spin on the idea that what is deemed worthless to one person might be valuable to another.  
The succinct retort ""thanks, but no thanks"" is a polite way of declining something undesirable.  
When faced with undesirable circumstances, the saying ""make lemonade from lemons"" suggests making the best out of a bad situation.  
There isn't a direct proverb, but the phrase ""this thing is more trouble than it is worth"" conveys a similar sentiment.  
When someone has created an undesirable situation for themselves, the phrase ""that's your row to hoe"" can be applied, although it traditionally refers to a difficult task in general.  
For something one finds worthless, ""I wouldn't take it as a gift"" can humorously express complete lack of interest.  
The term ""waste of space"" can be used to describe a useless possession.  
One might use the expression ""you couldn't give it away"" to highlight the complete lack of demand for an object.  
A common adage, ""you get what you pay for,"" is used to communicate that low cost often equates to low quality, especially for free items.  
In the software industry, ""eating one's own dog food"" suggests that developers should use the software they create.  
The caution ""just because it's free doesn't mean you can afford it"" warns against the hidden costs associated with seemingly free goods. 
The phrase ""good riddance to bad rubbish"" might be used to dispose of a faulty item rather than return it to the giver.  
Using the saying ""a bad penny always turns up"" could convey the futile effort to dispose of a persistently returning item.  
In British English, receiving a ""poisoned chalice"" metaphorically means obtaining something that does more harm than good.  
And finally, phrases like ""don't air your dirty laundry (in public)"" or ""keep your dirty laundry to yourself"" suggest keeping one's shameful situations private; on the other hand, ""don't hide your light under a bushel"" or ""put your best foot forward"" mean the opposite."

why are clothes “hung” but men “hanged”?,"Historically, the English word for ""hang"" had different origins and forms; in Old English, there were specifically two distinct words, ""hon"" and ""hangen.""

how is a in mathematics pronounced?,"The term ""A prime"" is commonly used to denote the symbol 'A' followed by a single prime mark.  
When a double prime mark is added, it's referred to as ""A double prime"". 
In previous generations, it was argued that ""a dash"" was used in the UK, but ""a prime"" has overtaken this since.

how do you pronounce numbers written in different bases?,"Developers typically articulate each number in non-decimal bases instead of grouping them. 
Moreover, it's advisable to read out the symbols as they're written in numerical systems other than decimal, without referring to them as ""digits"" if alphabets are included. 
Additionally, it's suggested to categorize numerals into groups of three, analogous to bytes, to facilitate easier pronunciation across different bases. 
If you're pronouncing numbers in bases other than decimal, be consistent about the base reading you're using: for example, if you're discussing octal numbers, be sure to use the natural octal reading for each number."

why do americans go downtown whilst people in the uk go up town?,"The term ""downtown"" originally referred to the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which was the first settled part and formed the historical core of New York City.  
Over time, the term was gradually accepted in other cities across the United States and Canada to denote their central business districts.  
The development of New York City significantly influenced the concept of 'Downtown,' which is a term commonly used in the travel industry of the UK for tourists, although it might sound foreign to British ears.  
In the context of UK railways, London is conventionally referred to as 'up,' irrespective of actual geographical directions, a convention that stems from London historically being at the top of early railway timetables."

why do we refer to computers and other machines as being up or down?,"The term ""up/down"" as applied to machines is an instantiation of a Metaphor Theme, where the vertical dimension of being up is more and down is less is a significant English metaphor.  
The connotations used, such as to start up and shut down machines, may be connected to this metaphorical usage, suggesting activity and inactivity. 
This metaphor extends to the notion of a machine being considered alive/awake or dead/sleeping, depending on whether it is operationally functional or operationally dormant. 
The design of many switches, which typically are flipped up for ""on"" and down for ""off,"" contributes towards a tangible aspect rooted in physical interactions. 
Lastly, the use of mathematical terminology, which incorporates observations rooted from the real world supports this language."

what is the difference between a music group and a band?,"Generally, ""group"" tends to describe any assembly of music performers, while ""band"" specifically indicates individuals who play musical instruments. 
However, there isn't a strict distinction between the two, as the term 'group' has also commonly referred to musical ensembles, especially outside of the music industry and among casual observers, even as 'band' carries a bit more 'street cred'. 
Moreover, a 'group' might focus primarily on vocals, possibly including performers who just sing or incorporate dance without playing instruments.  
In contrast, the term 'band' often implies a combination of instrumental and vocal performance.  
Despite the origins of the words being different, they are currently used interchangeably in many contexts. 
Yet, the term 'band' suggests that its members play instruments, thus not all groups can be categorized as bands. 
Additionally, a ""group"" is perceived to represent a professional relationship among its members, whereas a ""band"" may suggest a more casual and emotionally bonded association."

"The Super League side moved from their Willows home in 2012 after 110 years at their former ground. Former dual-code Wales international Harris, 39, had a 17-month stint as head coach at Salford. Growing up and playing against Salford for many years, they were always a passionate club, he said. Harris told Rugby League Extra: I think what's been a big struggle for them is the move to a new stadium. Part of what was symbolic with Salford whenever I went there was the stadium - although it was creaking, it still had that home feel about it and you're in Salford. I'm not sure the new stadium has got that and I'm not sure that Salford, as a club, have quite got the identity which they probably had 10 years ago. It's whether they can recapture that identity of what Salford was, because the fans are fantastic. If they can capture that identity again, I think that's how they can improve.","Salford Red Devils have lost some of their identity after their move to the AJ Bell Stadium, says former head coach Iestyn Harris."

what is the difference between lunch and dinner and supper?,"In most cultures, dinner is typically the most substantial meal of the day.  
Supper is generally a lighter evening meal, and lunch is considered a lighter midday meal similar to supper but served around noon.  
Within American English, lunch specifically denotes a midday meal occurring around 11:30 am to 1:30 pm, and the terms dinner or supper refer to an evening meal typically between 5 pm and 7 pm.  
On farms in the American Midwest during the 1920s, lunch would be a smaller meal delivered in the late morning, with dinner being a small hot meal in the afternoon, and supper as a larger hot meal served after dark.  
In some regions of the southeastern United States, supper is associated with a calm, family meal, whereas dinner is similar to lunch but later in the day.  
Dinner is sometimes perceived as a special or occasional kind of supper that features more food than an ordinary supper. 
In the midwestern United States in the 1950s, the mid-day meal would be called lunch if it was light or dinner if it was a large meal akin to a Sunday Dinner.  
In Nigeria, lunch is associated with the afternoon, while dinner refers to a meal at night.  
However, in India, the term supper is rarely used; lunch indicates the meal taken in the afternoon, and dinner signifies a meal taken at night.  
New Zealand generally considers lunch the meal around noon and supper a late evening snack.  
In southern England, lunch is understood as the midday meal and supper as the evening meal, with dinner becoming the term for a more formal or substantial evening meal.  
Coming from a traditional British household in Canada, the midday meal is lunch, whereas supper refers to a small informal meal before bed, and dinner is the most formal meal of the day, typically taken at the dinner table.  
On the other hand, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, lunch can also denote a light evening meal, while dinner at midday was a heavier main meal, contrasting with supper before bed. 
Someone who experienced many cultures growing up reports meal times as follows: Breakfast = From 2:00am - 10:00am, Coffee = From 4:00am - 10:00am (also a drink/beverage), Brunch = From 10:00am - 1:00pm (used mainly on weekends & social gatherings), Lunch = From 11:00am - 2:00pm, Tea = From 2:00pm - 5:00pm (also a drink/beverage), Dinner = From 5:00pm - 10:00pm, Supper = From 7:00pm - 12:00am and Snack = (single food item between meals) but also notes there are no set rules, and meal terminology can also hinge on the composition of the meal, the number of courses served, and who you are dining with."
"The 52-year-old, a former international in both sports, took 2-24 after turning out for Scotland veterans in their 125-run defeat by Lancashire over-50s.

Mr Ferguson said: The rollout has done what I hoped it would do, with most opposition fading once a scheme goes live, and the majority of residents and traders being pleasantly surprised. The feedback we're getting is that parking becomes much easier in the residents' parking zones. He added that he would ask for the views of local councillors and neighbourhood partnerships before reconsidering an extension to the scheme.",The final residents' parking zone (RPZ) has been introduced in Bristol.

what is the difference between hiring and renting?,"In the United States, the term ""rent"" typically refers to the use of objects like cars or houses, whereas ""hire"" generally pertains to employing people or services. 
""Rent"" implies a financial transaction for the utility of an object, property, or service, whereas ""hire"" indicates payment for services rendered by an individual or organization. 
When you rent something, you use that object yourself to complete a task, while hiring suggests that the individual or entity you've engaged is meant to complete the task on your behalf. 
In British English, goods and accommodation are commonly rented, possibly under a rent-to-own arrangement too, while hiring is reserved for temporary use of objects or professional services. 
Furthermore, in both the UK and the US, ""hire"" and ""employ"" are terms utilized to bring people into workforces on varying contractual terms."

indefinite articles used with plural nouns: it was an amazing two days,"In certain expressions, plural nouns are used to convey singular collective entities when they come together to form a singular conceptual entity: in the context of phrases like ""an amazing two days,"" it suggests that a ""noun+of"" structure (ie, ""an amazing period of two days"") has been implicitly assumed. 
This grammatical construction, indefinite + adjective + unit of measurement, is likened to the use of collective nouns, which use both singular and plural indefinite articles. 
Another way to look at it is that phrases like ""an amazing two days"" represent a generalization of the concept that English number expressions inherited from their partitive history a limited ability to act like singular noun phrases."

This was mainly due to the most prevalent strain of the flu virus impacting younger people rather than older people, who are more at risk.","There were 24,300 excess deaths in England and Wales last winter - about half the number of the previous year."

is fine better than good?,"In short, fine is better than something that is merely good.  
Something that is fine implies a level of quality or ability that surpasses mere goodness, suggesting superiority or excellence.  
In contrast, while good indicates a positive or desirable state, it does not necessarily imply a high level of quality beyond being simply not bad.  
In idiomatic expressions, however, ""That's fine"" can be equivalent to saying ""That's good,"" despite the subtle differentiation in other contexts.  
When referring to one's health in response to concern, especially in the UK, it is more appropriate to say, ""I feel fine"" rather than ""I feel good""."

Expressions using ""two cents"" in the context of minimal worth, like ""put in [one's] two cents,"" have been documented since at least the late 1800s."

Lord Ashdown said: Tim's a very able guy but at the moment judgement is not his strong suit. He was asked about Mr Farron's comments on Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. The Lib Dem election campaign chief, and former leader, went on to say: I know Tim very well. He is a great campaigner, a good friend of mine. I think his well-known ambitions would probably be better served with a little more patience and a little more judgement. Mr Farron was quoted as saying: In 2010, many people said: I am not voting for you because of the Lib Lab pact (in the 1970s) when I was seven years old. Just think what going into coalition with the Tories will do to our brand over the next generation.

nothing to tell versus nothing to say,"""There's nothing to say"" tends to refer to a lack of response to an issue or topic rather than a narrative, often indicating that the speaker believes a response is unnecessary or they are unwilling to provide one. 
On the other hand, ""There's nothing to tell"" suggests that there is no narrative or significant story to convey, either due to the absence of noteworthy events or the speaker's decision to withhold the information. 
These expressions are similar but nuanced and can carry a variety of meanings depending on the context in which they are used."
do brits understand rhyming slang or are they sometimes puzzled by it too?,"Many Britons may not understand rhyming slang as it appears to be a form of English with meanings that can vary based on the speaker's intent.

Rhyming slang terms like 'pork pies' meaning 'lies' are known to some, but many are obscure and seem to lack a uniform structure or meaning.  
Despite its complexity and local variations, common Cockney Rhyming Slang terms have entered common usage without many knowing their original rhyming phrases."

which is correct: troubleshooted or troubleshot?,"The correct past form of ""troubleshoot"" is ""troubleshot,"" despite it sounding unusual to some.  
Similarly, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, ""troubleshot"" is considered the accurate simple past and present perfect form of the verb.  
There's an indication that some dictionaries acknowledge ""troubleshot"" as the proper past tense while others list ""troubleshooted"" as a variant.  
Nevertheless, usage experts like Garner and Wallraff prefer ""troubleshot,"" despite the fact that there's some level of disagreement or avoidance of the past tense altogether."

why is the letter q almost always followed by the letter u?,"The appearance of ""qu"" in English words frequently corresponds to presence in the original term from which the word is derived.  
This spelling convention is rooted in Latin and generally represents the sound , following ancient customs of writing this particular sound sequence as QV.

position is to space as what word is to time?,"A moment is a specific point or instant in time.  
An instant describes an infinitesimally small moment where the passage of time is instantaneous, and it's a term often used in mathematical and technical contexts.  
A date is similar to a position in time with the granularity of one day, whereas adding the time of day allows for finer precision.  
Using the phrase ""point in time"" can indicate that you are referring to time rather than space.  
The term epoch in common usage can denote a historical era, while in a scientific context, it represents a point on the universal timeline.  
Moment and instant are preferred terms for precise time locations, whereas duration, extent, period, run, stretch, while span, tide, and spell are similar to the concept of position but represent longer time intervals.  
In the software, the standard language used is date-time, without a time-zone, following the ISO-8601 calendar system.  
However, no specific English word equivalent to 'position' denotes exact time location; common phrases used to inquire about someone's time location might be framed as questions regarding the current time."
is there a word for someone who youve not physically met but know well?,"There are many possible terms which may reflect someone whom you've not met in person but know well. 
For one, an ""online friend"" is someone you might only interact with through the internet, forming a bond and sharing commonalities similar to a traditional offline relationship, where the interaction can include exchanging photos, emails, and potentially lead to phone conversations, offering a sense of emotional support even without meeting in person.  
This is not unlike the term ""pen friend"" or ""pen pal"", which was used before the advent of the internet to describe a friend with whom one exchanges physical letters, often found through contact details in magazines, potentially with the purpose of language exchange, shared interests, among other things.  
However, nowadays in cyberspace, one can engage in numerous activities, including making ""cyber friends"" amid a plethora of cyber-related activities.  
Further to this, ""e-quaintance"" or ""ecquaintance"" are neologisms proposed for such online friends, along with ""cyber-buds"" or ""cyber buddies"" as casual terms for friends made online, while ""long distance friends"" is a term used to describe such relationships within internet communities, inclusive of those friends one has not met in person."

The justices voted 5-4 to grant an emergency appeal from the clinics after a federal appeals court had earlier upheld the new Texas law. Clinics have argued that the measures will lead to a second major wave of Texas clinic closures in as many years. The southern US state had 41 abortion clinics in 2012 but only 19 remain. The new restrictions were due to take effect on 1 July. They require abortion clinics to meet hospital-grade standards and for doctors at the clinics to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Critics say both provisions are designed to shut down abortion providers and will force women to seek abortions at illegal and unlicensed facilities. Monday's ruling means clinics unable to meet the restrictions will remain open at least until the Supreme Court decides whether it will hear the appeal from clinics.,Several abortion clinics in Texas will remain open after the US Supreme Court decided to put strict new measures against them on hold.

In more detail, the order is based on observations such as size, shape, age, color, nationality, material, and type.  
This hierarchy further refines the arrangement as quality takes precedence over size, shape, color, provenance, value, dimension, physical property, speed, human propensity, age, and finally, color.  
Another guideline is that the locative adjective should directly precede the noun or verb it refers to.  
Additionally, the intrinsic or essential nature of the object determines the proximity of the adjective to the noun."

"Kurz vor der geplanten Abstimmung über das EU-Austrittsabkommen im britischen Parlament am Dienstag sind die Pfund-Anleger nervös. Der Kurs der britischen Währung pendelte zuletzt in engen Spannen hin und her.

is i like dogs but cats a valid sentence?,"The use of ""but"", used here as a preposition meaning ""except"", is limited to talking about a subgroup of a group and should not be applied to two distinct groups; it is an incorrect application to say ""I like dogs except cats"".  
Furthermore, it is invalid to follow ""but"" with a simple noun as in ""I like dogs but cats""; a full sentence is expected instead.  
However, the statement could make sense with heavy emphasis on ""but"" and a pause, suggesting the rest of the intended meaning, for example, ""I like dogs but cats..."" might be implied to mean a dislike for cats. 


It's not valid because ""cats"" is not a full sentence, however, the sentence does actually makes sense if you say it with heavy intonation on the word ""but""."

"during the cold war, did americans/westerners call it such?","Yes, they did. 
The term ""cold war"" started to be utilized around the 1940s, with a peak in usage by the 1960s.

Anecdotally, individuals in high school during 1957-1961 also remember the term being used to describe a non-military confrontation at that time, and by 1977, the term was widely used. 
And in addition to this term, the term ""detente"" was also used later during the Cold War to describe efforts to reduce hostilities."

are there shibboleths specific to native russian speakers?,"Non-native English speakers from Russia often omit articles like ""a"", ""an"", and ""the"", use past tense incorrectly due to different tense structures in their native language, and may confuse the use of ""he"" and ""she"".

In addition to this, they tend to have difficulties with perfect tense forms, which they might replace with simpler past tense forms.  
Beyond this, Russian speakers may also form exceedingly long compound sentences, a potential influence from Russian prose or structural aspects of the language, and punctuation is crucial in Russian as it conveys intonation and meaning, hence errors in punctuation can lead to significant confusion.  
Additionally, issues also arise with the present tense of ""to be"" and the pronunciation of certain English sounds, which do not exist in Russian, like ""th"" which tends to turn into ""s"" or ""z""."

what informal english expression would you use to let a couple know that they are being too intimate in public?,"The phrase ""Get a room!"" is often used to suggest that a couple exhibiting public displays of affection should continue in private, ideally at a hotel.

why dont english nouns have grammatical gender?,"The diminishing use of gender in English has been linked to a combination of historical decay of inflectional endings and the influence of language contact and change.  
Specifically, it was due to a general decline in declension classes by the end of the 14th century, as well as a pattern of assimilating influences from Norman French and a mix of Danish and Old English, which led to lapsation and eventual dismissal of noun genders.  
Simply put, English is mostly genderless because, on two occasions, large groups of individuals couldn't recall each other's noun genders, often substituting 'the' instead of the correct pronoun."

a word for a joke so poorly told and so unfunny that one cannot help but laugh,"The type of joke you might be considering is a corny one.  
These jokes could be so bad that they are actually perceived as good.  
You could also use the term 'anti-joke', which delivers something intentionally unfunny or without intrinsic meaning, relies on an audience's expectation of humor, which when unmet, becomes comically ironic.  
'Dad jokes' are typically so simple or predictably lame that they provoke groans, yet they have a charm that can incite laughter despite their obvious lack of sophistication.  
Moreover, a term like 'train wreck' or 'car crash' might be suitable to describe a situation that is so terrible it becomes entertaining.  
Similarly, a 'shaggy dog story' is identifiable by its lengthy, anecdotal nature, culminating in an anti-climactic punchline.  
Lastly, a 'groaner' refers to a joke whose punchline prompts a mixed reaction of laughter and groaning, acknowledging the wit behind it despite any initial disappointment."

"washroom, restroom, bathroom, lavatory, toilet or toilet room","In the United States, ""restroom,"" ""washroom"" and ""bathroom"" are commonly used terms when referring to the room containing the toilet in a home or when seeking facilities in public. 
Canadians often refer to this room as the ""washroom"" and sometimes use ""bathroom"" if the room actually includes a bath. 
In England, the term ""toilet"" is more prevalently used, and ""loo"" is often used in a polite context, while ""toilet"" is almost universally used in Australia. 
In New Zealand, euphemisms like ""bowl lavatory"" and ""washroom"" or ""restroom"" are used similarly. 
The term ""lavatory"" was once used synonymously with ""washroom,"" from the Latin lavāre, meaning to wash, but now serves equally as a euphemism for rooms used for sanitation. 
""Toilet"" is a similar euphemism, originally referring to a small room with a supply of water where people would complete their daily washing and preparation routines."

"Former Scotland midfielder McInnes guided the Dons to second place in the Scottish Premiership last season. The 45-year-old has been in charge at Pittodrie since April 2013. It is not known whether he is the only candidate to replace David Moyes, who resigned following the Black Cats' relegation from the Premier League.

He left to take charge at Bristol City in October 2011, but was sacked in January 2013 with the club bottom of the Championship.

english equivalent of vietnamese rather kill mistakenly than to miss an enemy.,"One comes from Otto Von Bismarck who proclaimed that ""It is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape"" was proposed, signaling a severe stance on justice.  
Also, the expression ""It is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape"", also known as Blackstone's ratio would be another equivalent.  
Also, during the Vietnam War, a similarly drastic sentiment emerged with ""Kill 'em all; let God sort 'em out,"" a phrase used by some military personnel that seemingly originated from an earlier historical context. 
The phrase was updated to ""Kill ‘em all. Let Allah sort ‘em out"" in the context of subsequent American military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, reflecting a continuity of that attitude through time. 
Another relevant expression with a slightly different nuance is ""shoot first; ask questions later,"" which is often critical of actions taken without due consideration. 
Meanwhile another military related phrase is ""Shoot twice, aim once"". 
For a less serious take on impulsiveness in decision-making, Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" offers ""Sentence first - verdict afterwards,"" playing on the inversion of the typical judicial process. 
If a more metaphorical sentiment is sought, akin to acting badly to ensure safety, the sayings ""Better safe than sorry"" and ""It's better to be safe than sorry"" serve as cautious reminders, sometimes implying unjust precautions."

is there a verb for remaining silent?,"Numerous terms can describe the act of remaining silent. 
For one, the term ""schtum"" describes being silent and can be used both as an adjective and as a verb in British English to indicate maintaining silence or becoming non-communicative.  
To achieve or enforce silence, one could use the verbs ""to silence"" or ""hush,"" with the latter also serving as an interjection for quietness.  
Furthermore, ""to keep quiet"" or ""to remain quiet"" are phrases matching German ""schweigen,"" Dutch ""zwijgen,"" or French ""se taire,"" and they convey a voluntary state of silence.  
""Mute"" can signify deadening sound or, colloquially due to technology, to silence entirely.  
Other variations like ""keep mum,"" ""quiesce,"" and even invoking the Fifth Amendment illustrate the numerous ways one may express the act of being silent or ordering silence.  
Additionally, ""tacet"" is a verb derived from Latin that directly relates to remaining quiet.  
That said, although ""demur"" indicates a hesitation to speak out of disagreement, it may not perfectly fit the context of seeking silence.  
However, phrases such as ""keep mum"" and ""mum's the word"" serve to advise discretion or secrecy.  
And the verb ""quiet,"" while feeling somewhat awkward when used alone, is grammatically correct for expressing silence.  
Finally, ""dummy up"" is another informal command suggesting refusal to speak or to remain silent."

why god in godparent?,"One opinion suggests that this refers to the “role” of the godparents as God’s ""vicar"", specifically concerning the Christian sacraments and the spiritual and moral guidance of a child.  
Later developments established godparents to act as ""parents"", to an extent, in the eyes of God, with the implication of providing care in the absence of the child's biological parents.  
This relationship was formally recognized, typically during a child's christening, through a promise before God that said persons would take responsibility for their godchild in the event of the parents not being able to and to oversee the child's spiritual upbringing and welfare.  
The prefix ""god-"" in terms like 'godfather' and 'godmother' historically reflected the view that the sponsors enter into a spiritual relationship with the baptized person and with each other."

are illusion and hallucination the same?,"A hallucination involves seeing something that isn't there, while an illusion concerns misinterpreting something real.  
Illusions are common and experienced by normal individuals, usually through the same stimulus that leads most people to see the same false thing.  
Hallucinations, differentiated as false perceptions without an external stimulus, are individual experiences often linked to mental illness or drug use.  
An altered mental state causes hallucinations, whereas illusions can result from various factors but not altered mental states.  
A distinction is necessary between hallucinations, illusions, and other phenomena like dreams and mirages, recognizing that the brain processes experiences like visual illusions based on expectation, not on what is actually present."

is a whole nother grammatical?,"The term ""nother"" is not inherently ungrammatical; it's deemed informal and typically used to convey a casual tone.  
The expression ""a whole nother"" is definitely not a contraction of ""a whole another"" but rather a humorous insertion of ""whole"" into ""another"" for comic effect.  
Additionally, such usage qualifies as a case of tmesis, which is a grammatical construct that allows for the insertion of a word within another word, although this is more informal in nature.  
Lastly, the modification of ""another"" with ""whole"" to create ""nother"" has historical precedent since the fourteenth century and its use in such expressions, it seems a bit backwards to consider it an improper usage."

difference between little and small,"When describing people or animals, ""small"" typically refers to size, whereas ""little"" often points to age, though it can also indicate size.  
The term ""little"" may function as a quantifier, indicating the amount of something, while ""small"" is associated with size and is used in comparative and superlative forms.  
A key distinction is that only ""little"" is applicable for indicating quantities.  
When addressing attitudes toward the described item, ""small"" may imply something is undersized or smaller than usual, and ""little"" can convey endearing qualities.  
Moreover, ""little"" might denote something unimportant or trivial, which is less common for ""small"".  
Finally, ""little"" is generally more fitting when referring to people, especially in non-literal or emotional contexts, whereas ""small"" is preferable for discussing the physical size of concrete objects in neutral settings."

"whats a parallel for mitigate, for worsening a good situation?","Words that intensify the negativity of a situation include ""exacerbate,"" ""aggravate,"" and informally, ""worsen"".  
On the other hand, ""negate"" may serve as an antonym to ""mitigate,"" potentially neutralizing an effect.  
If the intent is to express the diminishment of something positive, terms such as ""vitiate,"" which means to impair quality or value, or ""compromise,"" which conveys damage or reduction in degree, could be appropriate.  
Similarly, ""dissipate"" can describe the squandering of something good like money, energy, or resources.  
While ""mitigate"" is suitable for lessening the negative effects, ""diminish"" might be a more precise choice for lessening positive ones, along with ""reduce"".  
""Undermine"" can also be applied if something insidiously weakens a good thing.  
Other options to denote the weakening of good effects include ""weaken,"" ""dilute,"" and again ""negate"".  
The American Heritage Dictionary defines ""mitigate"" as to ""moderate,"" which can apply to both lessening severity and intensity.  
""Adulterate"" indicates the debasement of something, while ""degradation"" suggests the decline of a positive situation.  
In colloquial terms, ""degrade"" might be used to describe the decline in benefits of a tactic."

will the word schadenfreude be understood in an english text?,"The term ""schadenfreude"" has seen an increased use in the English language and is understood to mean deriving pleasure from others' misfortunes.  
However, it would not be widely recognized by the majority of English-speaking adults, as its current usage is still negligible.  
Furthermore, there is a consensus that the term isn't generally understood, and anecdotes reflect that only a minor portion of certain professional groups, such as IT personnel, might be familiar with it. 
Consequently, its use in writing is suggested to be accompanied by context or a brief definition, especially since English often integrates loanwords from other languages."

"why is it your majesty, but my lord?","Explaining ""my lord"" is easy: ""my lord"" is the person who is the lord of me, ""your lord"" would be the person who is the lord of you. 
 ""Lord"" is a title while ""majesty"" comes from the adjective majestic, so ""your majesty"" means ""you who are majestic"", while ""my lord"" means ""the lord of me"". 
The word ""lord"", originally and all throughout its history, referred to someone, a person (or a personification of God, as opposed to God as an abstract concept). 
The word ""majesty"", on the other hand, always referred to something, a concept, a trait that was attributed to someone. 
Very succinctly, ""majesty"", ""grace"", ""honor"", and ""royal highness"" are qualities of the exalted person being addressed, while ""lord"", ""liege"", and ""king"" are titles describing the superior relationship of the one addressed (superior to me, that is)."
"Why? Because of compound interest. When you save money, it earns interest. The lump sum grows from interest being added every year or every month. Interest added on top of that interest is known as compound interest - and means that the longer you save, the better off you are. So people who leave it late - like Dave in the example above - have compounded their financial problems when it comes to cashing in their savings. But it is worth remembering that pensions usually depend on the success of investments which, unlike savings, do not guarantee a set level of interest.",Saving a small amount of money regularly from when you start work will leave you better off than saving a bigger amount in later life.

etymology of the use of drive to refer to a digital storage medium,"The OED describes ""disc drive"" as a synonym for a mechanism that rotates a disc, essentially a storage device with rotating mechanisms and read/write heads.  
Merriam-Webster defines ""drive"" as a device for reading and writing on magnetic media such as tapes or disks.  
The term expanded to include optical storage and flash memory, even though these don't involve physical movement.  
The name ""hard drive"" began to be used to distinguish it from ""floppy drive,"" while the term ""drive"" has been applied to various storage replacements and even remote file storage, like network drive and Google Drive.  
In addition to preserving its original meaning, ""drive"" has also taken on a figurative sense, becoming a term for any device that replaces traditional storage drives.  
This figurative meaning has extended even further to describe the entire system unit or tower of a personal computer.  
In electronics, a ""driver"" is a circuit providing an input-output interface, and ""device drivers"" serve as interfaces between the device and the operating system.  
Publications from the 1950s referred to ""tape drive"" regarding the mechanism alone, which confirms that originally ""drive"" referred to the component that imparts motion to a storage medium.  
Magnetic tape drives, which emerged around 1948, are likely the starting point of the term ""drive,"" which eventually transferred to disk storage units, with the term loosely applying to each new replacement technology.  
Originally, ""drive"" denoted the machinery for moving the storage media within a device, but over time, it has come to denote the whole storage unit itself.  
Records show that ""drive spindle,"" a term used in sound reproduction and mechanical engineering for a shaft that rotates to drive a disc, dates back to the 19th century, which further evolved into ""phonograph drive"" and thus ""tape drive"" and ""disk drive""."

what is the difference between job work and occupation?,"Occupation and employment are similar, but job is the one that specifically refers to a professional vocation. 
A job specifically refers to something you are doing for money or work.  
Employment and occupation both refer to having or looking for a job, with occupation delving more into the specific 'field' or 'type' of work you perform.  
A job equates to something you are doing for money, and employment implies consistent remuneration for ongoing work.  
Occupation and profession are similar in that they both refer to the general type of work, but a key difference is that an occupation may require specialized training and a profession normally requires specialized schooling.  
Lastly, in the frame of a job interview, your employment or profession would reflect your qualifications and field of study, whereas your occupation/job would be what it is that you are currently working as."

how can i prove a word is a noun?,"In English, nouns are defined by several characteristics: they can be modified by adjectives but not by adverbs, and they do not take direct objects. 
Nouns cannot have direct objects, which is a unique property differentiating them from verbs. 
Regarding the term 'weekdays,' it is identified as a noun because it has a plural form, and it can be used with the determiner 'every'. 
This suggests that 'weekdays' behaves like other common nouns in terms of grammatical structure. 
Moreover, there is no universal test that can accurately identify nouns in every instance."

what is the difference between love and lover?,"The term ""lover"" typically indicates a sexual relationship, whereas ""love"" can convey a broader range of affectionate feelings not necessarily involving a sexual aspect.  
When someone refers to ""my love,"" it expresses warmth, deep affection, or strong fondness towards another individual—this could apply to various relationships, including familial ones and does not imply that a physical relationship exists.  
Conversely, the term ""lover"" is reserved for a person with whom one has a sexual relationship, and it might denote relationships driven by passion and lust that could fizzle out over time or involve romantic affairs outside of marriage.  
""My love"" evokes romanticism, commitment, and tender emotions, while ""my lover"" suggests a more sexually charged connection."

was man a gender-neutral word in common usage at some point?,"Yes, historically the term ""man"" did imply both genders and was used to encompass women by implication. 
In Old English, ""man"" could refer to both adult males and human beings of either sex. 
It was a common usage to use terms like ""spokesman"" and ""craftsman"" without raising gender questions. 
However, as evidenced in the transition from ""where no man has gone before"" in Star Trek to ""where no one has gone before,"" the word ""man"" was undoubtedly used to imply ""human"" in general. 
The term remained gender-neutral when referencing humans collectively until the late 20th century, with the gender-neutral definition previously being more broadly applied. 
In Early Old English, 'man' was used without regard to gender; however, later, gender-neutral usage became more restricted, and male-specific usage became more common, influenced by the development of feminism."

word a male can use to refer to a female that is not old or young (girl/lady/woman),"When referring to an individual in a professional or casual context, ""woman"" is often the most neutral term to use.  
For instance, if it's important to mention that you spoke to a female individual, phrases like ""I met this great woman today"" can successfully highlight her contribution without being awkward.  
That being the case, in a business setting, it is sometimes preferable to use the person's job title such as colleague, manager, or analyst, which avoids emphasizing gender and focuses on the professional relationship.  
Additionally, when discussing business contacts or potential connections, highlighting the relevance of the individual to the business, such as saying ""She had keen thoughts on the project,"" is a clear and respectful approach.  
And in some cases, using gender-neutral terms like “someone” or the specific job title can also be appropriate.  
Beyond these approaches, the term ""lady"" can also be respectful and emphasize professional abilities.  
However, as a final note, an individual's natural way of speaking is usually the best guide, and if ""woman"" feels more comfortable than ""girl"" or ""lady,"" that's likely the best choice to use."

is there a general rule for the prefixation of un- and de- to words?,"The prefix ""de-"" generally suggests an action, while ""un-"" tends to imply a passive state. 
Some argue that ""de-"" should be applied to verbs and ""un-"" to adjectives, as ""de-"" conveys reversal when attached to verbs. 
On a word-by-word basis, the choice between ""un-"" or ""de-"" varies, and one is usually preferred over the other. 
In usage among verbs, ""un-"" denotes the intrinsic undoing of an action, while ""de-"" means to reverse the effects of an action without altering the original item."

what is the difference between “venom” and “poison”?,"Venom is a substance that living organisms contain and utilize for survival through offensive or defensive actions; it is typically harmful to its intended targets.  
Venom specifically refers to toxic substances produced by animals, such as snakes and scorpions.  
It becomes dangerous only when it enters the bloodstream, distinguishing itself in that it isn't generally harmful through skin contact or ingestion unless there are open wounds.  
Poison, on the other hand, can be any harmful or dangerous substance, and its harmful effects are triggered when it is ingested or absorbed through body tissues.  
Poison is also a more general term for harmful substances and can pertain to both naturally occurring materials and synthetics. 
When a person is harmed by a venomous animal or exposed to a poisonous substance, they are considered poisoned. 
Whereas poisons include a wide range of harmful substances, venoms are specifically secreted by certain animals and are typically introduced into the body through a bite or sting."

how to vs. how do i,"The phrase ""How to...?"" is generally acceptable in many scenarios where it is likely to appear, especially as a heading. 
""How do I...?"" is preferred when you are the one asking, as it tends to be more common. 
Although ""How to...?"" isn't a complete grammatical sentence, it is recognized in questions and answers. 
To make it complete, a subject and a conjugated verb are necessary.  
The query ""How to correct this error?"" lacks a subject and a conjugated verb, which makes inquiries like ""How do I correct this error?"" or ""How would you correct this error?"" appear more complete. 
The phrase ""How do I..."" implies the inquiry is about the person asking or someone else if quoted. 
In contrast, ""How to..."" could be used more variably without indicating who is performing the action."

does a fact have to be true?,"A fact must be true when the term is used, reflecting something that is believed to be true at that time.  
Moreover, a fact is what exists or manifests in reality and can be empirically confirmed. 
Additionally, it is evident that a fact is that which happens or has happened, grounding it in existence and reality. 
It's recognized that there are universal facts that are true under all circumstances, as well as facts that are dependent on individual belief, which may not be universally true.  
Facts are also noted to be true since the concept of a fact generally falls within the subset of what is considered true.  
When referring to a fact without clarification, it is implied that one is referring to something true.  
Notably, a fact doesn't necessarily have to be true; it may also represent a claim that is disputed or unproven. 
A fact may also be understood as either something that is true or a claim presented as being true.  
Some firmly believe that ""true"" means ""logically proven to be absolutely, universally, eternally true"".  
A common understanding is that facts are believed to be true or have an objective reality."

none as plural indefinite pronoun,"In usual language usage, especially when referring to books, the term ""none"" when followed by a verb will more commonly be used in the plural form, for instance, ""None of the books are..."" as this tends to sound more natural in conversation.

"Her commitment to the Commonwealth has been unwavering; that of her ministers, in the past, less so. Take Ted Heath.  For him, in the 1970s, the Common Market trumped the Commonwealth. Other prime ministers have been wary of a loose affiliation of nations that battled against apartheid in South Africa but which have, sometimes, struggled to uphold principles of accountability and respect for human rights. But post-Brexit, the club of 52 countries is taking on greater significance for the UK government. The Commonwealth makes up a relatively small part of UK trade.

idiom criticizing a person who has unsolved problems but tries to give someone advice about them,"The idiom ""Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach"" suggests a cynical viewpoint that teachers are those who have not succeeded in their professional fields. 
Similarly, ""The blind leading the blind"" describes an inept individual advising someone in the same situation. 
The retort ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" questions the validity of wisdom absent financial success. 
The expressions ""Look who's talking,"" ""You should talk,"" and ""You're a fine one to talk"" are used when someone criticizes or advises on something despite having the same issue themselves. 
The proverb ""a bald man who lays down the law about how to make hair grow"" ironically addresses those who advise on things they have no experience with. 
""Never trust a skinny chef"" implies that a good chef would sample their own cooking and likely not remain skinny as a result. 
""Physician, heal thyself"" suggests that one should be able to address one's own problems or defects before solving others'. 
The adage ""He should throw no stones, who lives in a glass house"" advises against criticizing others when one also has faults. 
The playful exchange ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?"" mirrors the sentiment of someone not practicing what they preach, similar to ""the bald man selling hirsute secrets."" 
The saying ""The pot calling the kettle black"" denotes hypocrisy, where the accuser shares the same flaw they point out in others. 
The sentiment ""Don't take marriage advice from the divorced"" suggests not to trust guidance from someone who has failed in the area they are advising on. 
Equivalently, ""Never trust the advice of a man in difficulties"" or ""When the rats want advice, they never ask the mice"" warn against following guidance from someone currently facing troubles. 
If a person is displaying hypocrisy, one might hear retorts like ""As if you are one to talk"" or ""That's rich, coming from you."" 
""Practice what you preach"" is a biblical allusion encouraging individuals to follow their own advice. 
Lastly, ""Do not complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof, when your own doorstep is unclean"" is another way of saying one should focus on correcting their own faults before criticizing others."

what is the difference between job and employment?,"In terms of employment lexicon, ""employment"" is associated with the ongoing relationship between the worker and their work, while ""job"" pertains more to an individual's specific position or function within an organization.  
Out of the colloquial, a job has a slightly different connotation as compared to employment. 
A job could mean post where someone is employed; however, employment refers more to a specific occupation where one earns a livelihood or the act of employing someone.  
While both terms are related and have same synonyms such as work, job is seen as the position held during regular employment, contrasting with employment, which is linked to the condition of being paid for work.  
The term ""job"" is less formal and is slightly more likely to be used to refer to less secure, lower status, and less career orientated positions."

what is the difference between ukraine and the ukraine?,"English speakers have traditionally used ""The Ukraine"" to refer to the country, a practice predating the Soviet Union. 
However, historically, the term ""Ukraine"" signifies a position on the edge, seen from the perspective of the Russian Empire, indicating its descriptive nature rather than being a proper name for a country. 
So, ""the Ukraine"" is a region of the world that has existed for some time, while ""Ukraine"" is the name of the country created after the fall of the USSR. 
And as such, as an independent nation today, Ukraine's name stands alone, not requiring additional qualifiers to distinguish it. 
And contrary to popular belief, the difference between using ""the"" and omitting it is more about adhering to political correctness and official guidelines rather than any fundamental linguistic rule."
